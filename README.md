# Connexion-Macro-Homosaurus

Macro for the OCLC Connexion client written by Wendy Isicson, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for adding MARC formatted 650_7 Homosaurus terms to bibliographic records.

These macros were written and tested using Connexion client version 3.1.8196.28365 on a PC running Windows 10.  Other configurations have not been tested for compatibility. 

The macrobook file is: Homosaurus_subjects.mbk. For installation help read the docx file. This macrobook codes the MARC for literature terms as 650_7s.

Optional macrobook file: LGBTQ_genre_lit.mbk. For installation help read the docx file. This macrobook codes the MARC for literature terms as 655_7s.  It only includes the literature terms and can be bound as seperate new keybind/button.

Read a .txt file to see the macro code.  This is 59 macros bundled together due to limitations for the size and complexity of Connexion macros.


Based on Homosaurus version 3.2. https://homosaurus.org/
