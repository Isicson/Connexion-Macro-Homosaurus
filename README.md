# Connexion-Macro-Homosaurus

Macro for the OCLC Connexion client written by Wendy Isicson, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for adding MARC formatted 650_7 Homosaurus terms to bibliographic records.  It also includes the option to add 655_7 Genre term formatting for literature terms.

These macros were written and tested using Connexion client version 3.1.8196.28365 on a PC running Windows 10 and Windows 11.  Other configurations have not been tested for compatibility. 

The macro book file is: Homosaurus_subjects.mbk. For installation help read "Installing and setting up the Connexion Macro for Homosaurus - public version" file available in both .pdf and .docx formats.  
You can run the macrobook by choosing to run the the "MainMenu" macro in Connexion's Macro Manager, or binding it to a keypress or User tool button.

Optional standalone macro book file: LGBTQ_genre_lit.mbk. For installation help read the docx file. This macro book codes the MARC for literature terms as 655_7s.  It only includes the literature terms and can be bound as separate new keybind/button.

Read a .txt file to see the macro code.  This is many smaller macros bundled together due to limitations for the size and complexity of Connexion macros.

Known issues:  Diacritics have been a challenge to include and have them properly print to Connexion.  I was able to get most diacritics printing correctly to the bibliographic records, but any word that uses a long dash over the letter "a" will display a diacritic in the dropdown menus.  For example, the word MƒÅori.

All errors in this creation are my own.  I would like to thank to Walter F. Nickeson for providing the code structure for the main menu redesign and additional coding support.  His Github offers a wide array of excellent Connexion macros.

This macro is based on the [Homosaurus vocabulary](https://homosaurus.org/) which is under [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 ](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) and has minor modifications to improve menu readability for terms duplicated within the same hierarchy.
