# Connexion-Macro-Homosaurus

Macro for the OCLC Connexion client written by Wendy Isicson, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for adding MARC formatted 650_7 Homosaurus terms to bibliographic records.  It also includes the option to add 655_7 Genre term formatting for literature terms.

These macros were written and tested using Connexion client version 3.1.8196.28365 on a PC running Windows 10.  Other configurations have not been tested for compatibility. 

The macrobook file is: Homosaurus_subjects.mbk. For installation help read the docx file.

Optional stand alone macrobook file: LGBTQ_genre_lit.mbk. For installation help read the docx file. This macrobook codes the MARC for literature terms as 655_7s.  It only includes the literature terms and can be bound as seperate new keybind/button.

Read a .txt file to see the macro code.  This is many smaller macros bundled together due to limitations for the size and complexity of Connexion macros.


Known issues:  Diacritics have been a challenge to include and have them properly print to Connexion.  I was able to get most diacritics printing correctly to the bibliographic records, but any word that uses a long dash over the letter "a" will display a diacrtic in the dropdown menus.  For example, the word MƒÅori.
